# wx-lite-game1

This repository contains documentation and a minimal TypeScript skeleton for the sample WeChat mini-game **Revenge of Bomb Cat**.

- See [`docs/RevengeOfBombCat_GDD.md`](docs/RevengeOfBombCat_GDD.md) for the full game design document.
- Source code lives in the `src/` folder. It provides basic managers and entity classes which can be expanded in a Cocos Creator project.

## Development

Install dependencies and compile the TypeScript files:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

The compiled JavaScript will be generated in the `dist/` directory.
